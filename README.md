最开始它只是一个普通的计算器，但后来它变的越来越像一个解释器了……

除了基本的运算和矩阵运算外，它还支持位运算、定义变量甚至自定义函数。

同样你也可以将指令储存在.cgl文件中并用计算器执行它。

在此基础上，现在它有了窗口程序。

在简洁干净的界面中输入指令，用“矩阵输入”功能方便快捷的生成并输入一个矩阵，或者直接将.cgl文件拖入窗口来执行。

At first it was just an ordinary calculator, but then it became more and more like an interpreter...

In addition to basic operations and matrix operations, it also supports bitwise operations, defining variables and even custom functions.

You can also store the instruction in a .cgl file and execute it with a calculator.

More, now it has a window program.

Enter instructions in a clean interface, use the "matrix input" function to easily and quickly generate and enter a matrix, or directly drag the .cgl file into the window to execute.
